# Naval

## This is a Work in Progress

A naval video game in the making...
The game is built on top of Bevy and *will* be great (lots of work before that...).

## Roadmap

Speed should stay unchanged with no action form user. Possible value should go from -50% to +100%

Collisions, canon and torpedo should only be possible every X secs.

It shouldn't be possible to fire with no amunition.

Canons on islands

Dummy enemies

- design sprites
- local player controls

Animations

- Boat movements generate waves.

Bases with flags

Multiplayer via network

Limit visibility of the player

Better manage screen size
